<p>Sharing some  links which I feel very useful when understanding the padding in kernel's code, you usually see those padding skill in some high performance application like 3D gaming.</p>
<p>Eric.S.Raymond have great Article about C struct padding, how it affect the actually memory size of your structure:<br />
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/">link</a></p>
<p>And there is a article from intel performance guide about how padding fix the "false sharing" issue in a SMP programming model.</p>
<p><a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/avoiding-and-identifying-false-sharing-among-threads">link</a></p>
<p>The link below is belongs to <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-guide-for-developing-multithreaded-applications">Intel Guide for Developing Multithreaded Applications</a>  which also valuable to read.</p>
<p>This link is from roguewave 's manual, which also have great detail about how actually memory layout by padding: <a href="http://docs.roguewave.com/threadspotter/2011.2/manual_html_linux/manual_html/ch05s01.html">link</a></p>
