<p>On filesystem tests, you should always test them before submitting them. Everyone can create a small filesystem like this:</p></p>
<pre class="brush: bash;light: true; fontsize: 100; first-line: 1; ">dd if=/dev/zero of=block bs=1M count=4000
mkfs.btrfs block mkdir mnt
sudo mount -o loop -t btrfs block mnt/ </pre>
<p>Maybe untar a kernel on it or something...  <br />Not sure.  <br />But if you mess up a filesystem people get annoyed.  :P
